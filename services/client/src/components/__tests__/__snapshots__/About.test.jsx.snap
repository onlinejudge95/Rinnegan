      With the advent of Machine Learning, the filed of sentiment analysis has become somewhat trivial. You can find pre-made solutions to find sentiment of a word in a given text. We built upon this functionality and made this system.

      Sentimental is a platform where a user can come and serach for a 
      <strong>
        sentiment analysis
      </strong>
       on a given 
      <strong>
        keyword
      </strong>
      . After he has finalized his choice, he will be shown the analysis for that word by choosing the corpus from
      <strong>
        one or more of the social media platorms
      </strong>
      . Currently we support the following platforms to fetch data from
    </p>
    <ul
      class="content"

      <li>
        Twitter
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p
      class="content"
    >
      As and when our infrastructure grows we will be using other platforms to include more diverse sentiments
