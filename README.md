## About

In compact form, rinnegan is sentiments as a service for an end user.
In today's world where **Sensationalism** is at an all time peak, it's really important for a user to know
what a collective group of people think about a particular _item/idea_.

Rinnegan tries to bridge the gap by providing a solution where a user can come and and search for sentiment of a keyword,
in a given timef rame from a limited sets of platforms.
